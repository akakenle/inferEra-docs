```py Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-***", #your aihubmix api keys 
    base_url="https://aihubmix.com/v1"
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        }
    ],
