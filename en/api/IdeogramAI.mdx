**ðŸŽ¨ Interface Description:**
Supports Ideogram AI drawing interface with strong text-to-image capabilities, including generate, remix, edit, upscale, and describe functionalities.

- **Remix:** Create new images based on a reference image and prompt.
- **Edit:** Make local edits to specific areas of a reference image using prompts and masks.
- **Upscale:** Enhance low-resolution images to high-resolution, with control over similarity and detail levels.
- **Describe:** Reverse-engineering prompts to describe images.

**Supported Styles:**

- AUTO: Default automatic selection
- GENERAL: General purpose
- REALISTIC: Realistic
- DESIGN: Design-oriented
- RENDER_3D: 3D rendering
- ANIME: Anime style

<Warning>
  1. Available through the official AiHubMix API or [Cherry Studio APP](https://cherry-ai.com/). Note that currently a proxy is required for image generation; direct connection within China will be supported in the future.
  2. Cherry Studio currently only offers the Ideogram drawing (generate) interface.
