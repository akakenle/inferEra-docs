## Claude Reasoning Models

Claude models do **not** enable reasoning mode by default. To access their deep reasoning capabilities, users typically need to invoke the Claude native API.

To make this capability available directly through an **OpenAI-compatible API**, we provide Claude models with the `-think` suffix. These models have reasoning mode **pre-enabled**, allowing users to leverage advanced reasoning without changing the invocation pattern.

### Supported Models

- [claude-sonnet-4-5-think](https://aihubmix.com/model/claude-sonnet-4-5-think)
- [claude-opus-4-5-think](https://aihubmix.com/model/claude-opus-4-5-think)

### Notes

1. Reasoning capability is explicitly selected via the **model name**
2. Claude reasoning models use the platform’s default context window and token limits:
   - Sonnet series: `max_tokens = 32k` by default
   - Opus series: `max_tokens = 64k` by default
3. No additional parameters are required; invocation is identical to standard models

## GPT Reasoning Models

GPT-series models support different **reasoning intensity levels** via model suffixes, enabling a balance between output quality, latency, and cost.

### Supported Models

- [gpt-5.2-high](https://aihubmix.com/model/gpt-5.2-high)

### Notes

1. The `-high` suffix indicates **high-intensity reasoning**, suitable for complex tasks and scenarios requiring high accuracy
2. Reasoning intensity is determined solely by the model name; no additional fields are required in the request

## Google Search–Augmented Models

Some Gemini models integrate **official Google Search capabilities**.  
By selecting a model with the appropriate suffix, search is automatically enabled during generation, with no additional parameters required.

### Supported Models

- [gemini-3-pro-preview-search](https://aihubmix.com/model/gemini-3-pro-preview-search)
- [gemini-3-flash-preview-search](https://aihubmix.com/model/gemini-3-flash-preview-search)

### Notes

1. Models with the `-search` suffix include built-in official Google Search capabilities and are suitable for:
   - Real-time information retrieval
   - External fact verification
   - Referencing the latest data
2. Search usage incurs **additional costs**, which are billed separately and recorded in independent usage logs
   - Detailed search cost breakdowns are not yet available in the current version and will be added in a future update
3. Only **OpenAI-compatible API formats** are supported:
   - Gemini native SDK is **not supported**
   - If using the official Gemini SDK, please refer to the non-reasoning model examples for the corresponding version
