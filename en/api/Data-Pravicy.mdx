## Data Collection Guidelines

### Data Storage Principles

AIHubMix does not actively store your prompts or model response content.

### What Data Does AIHubMix Store?

To ensure service quality and system stability, AIHubMix stores necessary metadata for each request (e.g., token count, latency, etc.). This information is used solely to support our reporting and model ranking, as well as your [usage statistics](https://console.aihubmix.com/statistics).

This metadata does not include your prompt content or model response text; it is limited to technical information related to the request itself.

<Info>
  OpenAI and Grok will take account restrictions or banning measures upon detecting content that may violate their usage policies and will send compliance notifications to AIHubMix.

  AIHubMix does not actively store prompts or responses. The platform only passively receives and retains relevant request information (including request time, prompt content, model response, and violation description) when an account is banned and a compliance notification is received.
</Info>

## Logs and Data Processing

Each AI provider integrated with the AIHubMix platform has its own data processing policy, including logging mechanisms and data retention periods.

### Vendor Data Policies

Based on compliance requirements, different service providers establish and enforce their own data retention policies.

The platform has summarized the data retention policies of major vendors. To review the complete terms, please refer to the official links of the respective providers.
