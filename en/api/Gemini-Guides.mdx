## Gemini 2.5 Flash support

We currently provides Gemini 2.5 Flash API support in a compatible way with Openai.
For quick tasks, you can use the following code to call the model **with no thinking**:
<CodeGroup>
```py Python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("AIHUBMIX_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://aihubmix.com/v1",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17-nothink",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the Occam's Razor concept and provide everyday examples of it"
        }
    ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

```shell Curl
curl -X POST https://aihubmix.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-***" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17-nothink",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain the Occam'\''s Razor concept and provide an everyday example of it."
      }
    ]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

For complex tasks, simply set the model id to the default `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` to enable thinking.

<Info>
Gemini 2.5 Flash uses the `budget` parameter to control the depth of thinking, ranging from 0 to 24K. The default budget is 1024, and the optimal marginal effect is 16K.
We will use the native Gemini support to allow developers to accurately control the budget.
