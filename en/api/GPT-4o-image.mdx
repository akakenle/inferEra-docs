## Interface Description

To meet the strong expectations of our users, we have specially launched two reverse-engineered interfaces: `gpt-4o-image` and `gpt-4o-image-vip`. The VIP model offers superior performance and stability.\
Please note that reverse-engineered interfaces cannot guarantee full stability and may encounter `üïê Queuing...` status or generation failures. They are recommended only for trial experiences and functional testing.\
OpenAI's official interface `gpt-image-1` has been released. Considering the cost of usage, the current reverse-engineered interfaces will be temporarily retained, with compatible calling methods provided for everyone.

## Notes

<Warning>
  - **Special Note**: Regardless of the cause, once the API call is initiated, charges will apply even if the generation fails.
  - The name of living artists (such as "Ghibli" and "Makoto Shinkai") will trigger `input_moderation` error, **causing generation failure**. You can avoid this by using non-sensitive words like "Ghibli" and "Bright Modern Japanese Anime Style".
  - In general, "style" is safer than "artist", like "Pixar" is also supported.
  - A more secure approach is to use the name of deceased artists or corresponding styles, such as "Van Gogh" and "Mona Lisa".
</Warning>

## Model and Pricing

| Model              | Price (\$/IMG) |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| `gpt-4o-image-vip` | \$0.009        |
| `gpt-4o-image`     | \$0.005        |

<Info>
  Due to the rising maintenance costs of reverse-engineered interfaces, the price per call has been increased.

## Compatibility with Official OpenAI API

If you prefer using the latest image generation method released by OpenAI, you can refer to the following implementation. Just keep these 3 points in mind:

1. Do not include the `quality` parameter ‚Äî models like `gpt-4o-image-vip` and `gpt-4o-image` have it bundled internally.
2. The `usage` field (token tracking) is not supported.
3. The latest output returns Base64-encoded image data, and the current script already handles automatic saving.

```py Python
from openai import OpenAI
import os
import requests
import base64

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="AIHUBMIX_API_KEY", # Replace with your AiHubMix API key
    base_url="https://aihubmix.com/v1"
)

prompt = """
redesign poster of the movie [Black Swam], 3D cartoon, smooth render, bright tone, 2:3
"""

result = client.images.generate(
    model="gpt-4o-image-vip",
    prompt=prompt,
    n=1, # Number of images to generate
    size="1024x1536", # 1024x1024 (square), 1536x1024 (3:2 landscape), 1024x1536 (2:3 portrait), auto (default)
    #quality="high" # Do not pass quality for reverse model, it's internally bound üìç
)

print(result) # Print full API response; usage not supported for reverse API üìç

# Define output filename prefix and directory
output_dir = "." # You can specify another directory
file_prefix = "image_gen-reverse"

# Ensure output directory exists
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Iterate through all returned image data
for i, image_data in enumerate(result.data):
    # Handle base64 string first
    if hasattr(image_data, "b64_json") and image_data.b64_json:
        image_bytes = base64.b64decode(image_data.b64_json)
        current_index = i
        while True:
            file_name = f"{file_prefix}_{current_index}.png"
            file_path = os.path.join(output_dir, file_name)
            if not os.path.exists(file_path):
                break
            current_index += 1
        with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(image_bytes)
        print(f"Image saved to: {file_path} (base64)")
    # Then handle url field (robust fallback in case of interface change)
    elif hasattr(image_data, "url") and image_data.url:
        try:
            response = requests.get(image_data.url, stream=True)
            response.raise_for_status()
            image_bytes = response.content
            current_index = i
            while True:
                file_name = f"{file_prefix}_{current_index}.png"
                file_path = os.path.join(output_dir, file_name)
                if not os.path.exists(file_path):
                    break
                current_index += 1
            with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
                f.write(image_bytes)
            print(f"Image saved to: {file_path} (url)")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Failed to download image #{i}: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred while processing image #{i}: {e}")
    else:
        print(f"No b64_json or url found in image #{i}, skipping save.")
```

## Effect Demonstration

<Card title="Girl with a Pearl Earring" img="/media/en/Girl-with-a-Pearl-Earring.PNG">
  1. The famous painting is reinterpreted, with text and watermark directly output.
</Card>

<Card title="Pixar" img="/media/en/pixar.png">
  1. The Pixar 3D Cartoon style, stable as ever.
</Card>

<Card title="Ghibli" img="/media/en/ghibli.png">
  1. The most popular Ghibli
</Card>

## Practical Tips

<Tip>
  - Support any language, Chinese drawing is also stable, but we don't recommend drawing a large amount of text.
  - Specify the aspect ratio in the prompt, otherwise 4o will automatically determine it. Supports 2:3, 3:2, 1:1.
  - Give reference images if you don't have inspiration, support single image and multi-image.
  - Upload images can be compressed for pre-processing, improve speed.
  - Support transparent background, no need to remove the background.‚Äî‚Äîjust add the requirement in the prompt.
