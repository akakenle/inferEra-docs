## Interface Description
As OpenAI has yet to officially release a GPT-4 image generation API, we've temporarily made two reverse-engineered endpoints—`gpt-4o-image` and `gpt-4o-image-vip`—available, enabling users to preview GPT-4o's powerful image creation capabilities.
Please note, these reverse-engineered endpoints do not guarantee consistent stability and are intended solely for early access and exploratory use.
Once OpenAI officially launches the GPT-4 image API, we will immediately discontinue these unofficial endpoints and seamlessly transition to the official stable release.

## Model and Pricing
| Model               | Pricing ($/IMG) |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| `gpt-40-image-vip` | $0.07 |
| `gpt-40-image`     | $0.03 |

## Python Example
Using the familiar `v1/completions` endpoint, we provide support, which is fully compatible. For specific usage, please refer to:
<CodeGroup>
```py Text-to-Image
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("AIHUBMIX_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://aihubmix.com/v1"
)

# Create a chat completion request
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-image-vip", #list: gpt-4o-image-vip, gpt-4o-image
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": """Redesign [Girl wearing a pearl earring] as an anime-style illustrated cover. Preserve original essence and composition. Render in refined Kyoto Anime-inspired style—soft brushwork, cinematic lighting, progressive depth. 
Format in AV cover layout: 
Japanese-English mixed typography, serif title with significant visual hierarchy - sense of design is the key.
Extract words tha conveys profound meanings as title, then creative slogan, the original name can be a smaller information ONLY if necessary.
Subtly embed watermark “jerlin” in clothing or background. Maintain emotional tone and posture, soften only when necessary. 2:3 portrait"""
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    stream=True
)

# Process the streaming response
for chunk in stream:
    try:
        if chunk.choices and len(chunk.choices) > 0 and chunk.choices[0].delta and chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="", flush=True)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nError occurred while processing the response: {str(e)}")
```

```py Text-to-Image with Image
```

```py Multi-Image with Text
```
</CodeGroup>

## Output Example
```
{
  "prompt": "Redesign 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' as an anime-style illustrated cover. Preserve the original essence and composition: the iconic side-glance pose, serene expression, and intimate framing. Render in refined Kyoto Anime-inspired style with soft brushwork, cinematic lighting, and progressive depth. Create an AV cover layout with Japanese-English mixed typography, using a prominent serif title with strong visual hierarchy. Extract profound words for the title and include a creative slogan. The original name 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' should appear as smaller text if needed. Subtly embed the watermark 'jerlin' in clothing or background. For modesty, replace any potential nudity with flowing fabric, hair, or veils while maintaining the emotional tone and posture. Soften details only when necessary.",
  "ratio": "2:3"
}

## Effect Demonstration
<Card title="Girl with a Pearl Earring" img="https://docs.aihubmix.com/cn/media/Girl-with-a-Pearl-Earring.PNG">
1. The famous painting is reinterpreted, with text and watermark directly output.
</Card>

<Card title="Pixar" img="https://docs.aihubmix.com/cn/media/pixar.png">
2. The Pixar 3D Cartoon style, stable as ever.
</Card>

<Card title="Ghibli" img="https://docs.aihubmix.com/cn/media/ghibli.png">
3. The most popular Ghibli
</Card>

## Practical Tips
<Tip>
- Support any language, Chinese drawing is also stable, but we don't recommend drawing a large amount of text.
- Specify the aspect ratio in the prompt, otherwise 4o will automatically determine it. Supports 16:9, 9:16, 2:3, 3:2, 1:1.
- Give reference images if you don't have inspiration, support single image and multi-image.
- Upload images can be compressed for pre-processing, improve speed.
- Support transparent background, no need to remove the background.——just add the requirement in the prompt.
</Tip>

## Notes
<Warning>
- The name of living artists (such as "Ghibli" and "Makoto Shinkai") will trigger `input_moderation` error, **causing generation failure but will be charged**. You can avoid this by using non-sensitive words like "Ghibli" and "Bright Modern Japanese Anime Style".
- In general, "style" is safer than "artist", like "Pixar" is also supported.
- A more secure approach is to use the name of deceased artists or corresponding styles, such as "Van Gogh" and "Mona Lisa".
</Warning>
