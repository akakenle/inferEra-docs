Aihubmix uses OpenAI model calling interface as the standard, aggregating multiple models including OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude and other series models. Calling any model uses the same method, just need to modify the corresponding `model ID`.

<Tip>
Key points: Only need to add the forwarding `base_url` and AiHubMix platform [API key](https://aihubmix.com/token) inside the client.
Model IDs can be obtained by clicking the "Copy Button" on [model marketplace cards](https://aihubmix.com/models).
</Tip>

## Basic Integration: Using OpenAI Official Library

### Python Example

```py Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-***", # Replace with your AiHubMix generated API key
    base_url="https://aihubmix.com/v1"
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Replace with any supported model ID
)

print(chat_completion)
```
