```

### 2️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Go to Aihubmix [Keys page](https://aihubmix.com/token) to generate your API key, then add this key and the forwarding URL to your system environment variables.

For example, add the following lines to your ~/.zshrc file:
```shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-***"
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://aihubmix.com"
```
<Tip>
For Mac users, you can reveal the hidden .zshrc file in your home directory by pressing `⌘ + ⇧ + .`. Open it with the system’s “TextEdit” app and add the above lines.
</Tip>

### 3️⃣ Apply the Configuration

After adding the configuration, run `source ~/.zshrc` in your terminal and press Enter to apply the changes.
