## Quick Setup Guide:

### 1️⃣ Install the npm Package Globally

Make sure your Node.js version is ≥ 20, then run the following in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code
qwen --version
```

For more details, refer to the[official repository](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)

### 2️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Add your Aihubmix key and forwarding address to your system environment variables. You can generate a key on the Aihubmix [Keys page](https://aihubmix.com/token).

For example, add the following to your ~/.zshrc:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_aihubmix_key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://aihubmix.com/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="your_model"
```

<Tip>
  For Mac users, you can reveal the hidden `.zshrc` file in your home directory with the shortcut `⌘ + ⇧ + .`. Open it with the system “TextEdit” app and add the lines above.
</Tip>

### 3️⃣ Apply the Configuration

After adding the configuration, run ‎`source ~/.zshrc` in your terminal and press Enter.

### 4️⃣ Launch and Use

Type the following in your terminal:

```shell
qwen
```

After launching, enter ‎`/about` and press Enter to confirm your setup. You’ll see the current version and the selected large language model:

<Note>
  Some users have reported that Qwen Code may occasionally get stuck. We recommend setting a **limited quota** for your [token↗](https://aihubmix.com/token) to avoid unnecessary waste.
</Note>

You’re now ready to use Qwen Code as normal.
