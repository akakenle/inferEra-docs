OpenCode now supports AiHubMix as a new model provider. You can use your AiHubMix API key within OpenCode to access its model services.

AiHubMix currently supports major model families, including GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Qwen.  For optimal performance in OpenCode, the following models are recommended:

- `claude-sonnet-4-5`
- `glm-4.6`
- `gpt-5`
- `gpt-5-codex`

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and launching OpenCode across different operating systems, as well as connecting it to the AiHubMix API.
