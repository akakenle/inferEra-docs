## API Overview

OpenAI's `gpt-image-1` image generation API offers both text-to-image generation and image-to-image editing with text guidance capabilities.\
Before using this API, please ensure you have the latest OpenAI package installed by running `pip install -U openai`.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
  - Once an API call is sent, **you will be charged regardless of any interruptions or failures** during the generation process
  - Names of living artists (such as "Hayao Miyazaki", "Makoto Shinkai", etc.) will trigger a `moderation_blocked` error, **causing generation to fail**. You can work around this by using non-sensitive terms like "Ghibli" or "bright modern Japanese anime style" instead. The same applies to images with revealing clothing or suggestive content.
  - Generally, referencing "styles" is safer than naming "artists" - for example, "Pixar" is supported.
  - A more reliable approach is to use deceased artists or their corresponding styles, such as "Van Gogh" or "Mona Lisa"

## Rejection Scenarios

Error message when a request is rejected:

```json
Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': 'Your request was rejected as a result of our safety system. Your request may contain content that is not allowed by our safety system.', 'type': 'user_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'moderation_blocked'}}
```

When requesting 2-10 images in a single generation, if the system detects that the request violates platform policies, the flagged content will not be generated. This may result in fewer images generated than the number originally requested. however, no `moderation_blocked` error will be thrown in multi-image generation.
Therefore, it‚Äôs recommended to proactively avoid potential intellectual property (IP) or copyright issues to minimize the risk of system rejection and ensure smooth generation.

**‚úçÔ∏è Key recommendations:**

- Avoid direct use of copyrighted characters, logos, celebrity likenesses, etc.
- Consider using "style inspiration", "creative reinterpretation", or "generalized descriptions" instead
- If referencing specific elements, check whether they fall within the public domain

## Practical Tips

<Tip>
  - Supports all languages. Chinese text works reliably, though we don't recommend generating large amounts of text in any language
  - The size parameter doesn't support explicitly passing size="auto" - auto is the default
  - Aspect ratios can be specified in the prompt (supports 2:3, 3:2, 1:1) or set via the size parameter
  - The `moderation` parameter controls sensitivity, but even with it set to "low," requests might still be rejected (e.g., if Venus is too revealing)
  - The edits endpoint doesn't support the `moderation` parameter
  - Combining text descriptions with reference images produces more accurate results
  - Compressing uploaded images as pre-processing can improve speed
  - Transparent backgrounds are supported (no need for manual cutouts) ‚Äî just add this requirement to your prompt
