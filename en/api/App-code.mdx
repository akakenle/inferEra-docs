Mainly used to optimize your API call costs, a unique identifier is generated based on your valid domain name. Add this identifier to your headers for immediate effect.

- **For platforms:** All Aihubmix API call costs for the platform are reduced, but individual users do not receive discounts.
- **For developers or regular users:** All Aihubmix API calls made through your tools enjoy discounts, even if initiated by your users.

After integrating and using it, you‚Äôll see the discounted requests reflected in your usage logs.
