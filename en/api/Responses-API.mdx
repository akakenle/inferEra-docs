Support the Openai Responses API multi-function interface, the following functions have been launched:

- Text input: Text input
- Image input: Image input
- Streaming: Streaming
- Web search: Web search
- Deep research: For complex analysis and research tasks
- Reasoning: Reasoning
- Functions: Functions
- image_generation tool usage: Image drawing and generation are billed under `gpt-image-1`.
- Code Interpreter: Allow models to write and run Python to solve problems
- Remote MCP: Calling a remote MCP server
- Computer Use: Computer Use

## Usage (Python call)：

Same as the official OpenAI call method, just replace `api_key` and `base_url` for forwarding.
Mainland China can access directly.

```py
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="AIHUBMIX_API_KEY", # Replace with the key you generated in AiHubMix
    base_url="https://aihubmix.com/v1"
)
```

<Tip>
  1. For inference models, the output inference summary can be controlled using the following parameter, with the detail richness of the summary ranked as detailed \> auto \> None, where auto provides the best balance.

  ```py
  "summary": "auto"
  ```

  2. Optional deep reasoning models: ‎⁠o3-deep-research⁠ and ‎⁠o4-mini-deep-research⁠, only supported on the ‎⁠responses⁠ endpoint.

**Note:**

1. The latest `codex-mini-latest` does **not** support search.
2. The **Computer use** feature requires integration with **Playwright**. It’s recommended to refer to the [official repository](https://github.com/openai/openai-cua-sample-app).

Known issues:

- Use cases are complex to invoke
- Takes many screenshots, which is time-consuming and often unreliable
- May trigger CAPTCHA or Cloudflare human verification, potentially leading to infinite loops
