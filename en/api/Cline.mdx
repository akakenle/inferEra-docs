## Prerequisites

- Obtain an **AIHubMix API Key**

  Get it here: https://console.aihubmix.com/token
- Install **Visual Studio Code** or **IntelliJ IDEA**

---

## Using Cline in VS Code

### 1. Install Cline

Open VS Code, go to the Extensions Marketplace, search for **Cline**, and install it.

### 2. Model Configuration & API Key

After installation, click the **Cline icon** in the left sidebar to open the configuration panel, then select an **API Provider**.

![Cline2 Pn](/public/en/cline2.png)

Switch the provider to **AIHubMix** and fill in the configuration fields.

| Setting      | Description                 |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- |
| API Provider | Select **AIHubMix**         |
| API Key      | Enter your AIHubMix API Key |
| Model        | Choose the model to use     |

### 3. Using Cline

Above the input box, you can control Cline’s read/write and command execution permissions via **Auto-approve**.\
Enabling these permissions improves automation but may increase token usage, so it’s recommended to turn them on only after you fully understand Cline’s behavior.

Cline offers two working modes, which you can switch at the bottom of the chat panel:

- **Plan Mode**: Focuses on information gathering, problem decomposition, and task planning. It does _not_ directly modify files.
- **Act Mode**: Executes changes, runs commands, and completes tasks based on the plan.

## Using Cline in IntelliJ IDEA

### 1. Install Cline

Open IntelliJ IDEA, go to the Plugins Marketplace, search for **Cline**, and install it.

### 2. Mode Selection

On first launch, select **Bring my own API Key → Continue**.

### 3. Model Configuration & API Key

After installation, click the **Cline icon** in the right sidebar to open the configuration page.

![Cline5 Pn](/public/en/cline5.png)

Switch the provider to **AIHubMix** and fill in the configuration fields.

| Setting      | Description                 |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- |
| API Provider | Select **AIHubMix**         |
| API Key      | Enter your AIHubMix API Key |
| Model        | Choose the model to use     |

### 4. Using Cline

The usage in IntelliJ IDEA is almost the same as in VS Code:

- You can enable **Auto-approve** above the input box.
- You can switch between **Plan** and **Act** modes at the bottom of the interface.

## Model Recommendations

Different stages of software development require different AI capabilities. Choosing the right model can improve efficiency in requirements analysis, coding, testing, and deployment.

### 1. Design & Architecture Phase

This phase relies more on abstract reasoning, system design, and domain knowledge. It’s better to choose models with strong reasoning and planning capabilities.

- o1
- gemini-2.5-pro

### 2. Development Phase

This phase requires stable performance in code generation, pattern understanding, function completion, and debugging suggestions. Choose models with strong, well-rounded coding capabilities.

- gemini-2.5-pro
- claude-sonnet-4-5
- gpt-5
- coding-glm-4.6（cost- effective）
- qwen3-coder-plus

### 3. Testing Phase

This phase focuses on edge cases, robustness, exception flows, and test case generation. It’s suitable to choose models that are good at code analysis and reasoning.

- claude-3-7-sonnet
- o3 / o4-mini
- gpt-5

### 4. Deployment & Review Phase

This phase benefits from models with large context windows that can understand entire codebases to perform audits, refactoring suggestions, or deployment verification.

- gemini-2.5-pro
- gpt-5
- o3 / o4-mini
