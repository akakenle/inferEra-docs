Tip: Translation software is advised not to use OpenAI's O-series and GPT-5 series models.

- For example: OpenAI Translator;  
- Change the API Key to one generated from [our siteâ€™s Key](https://aihubmix.com/token).  
- Change the API URL to:
```
https://aihubmix.com
```
(Note: Do not include a "/" at the end of the URL)

## If You Encounter Issues with Models Not Loading

If versions 0.4.33 and 0.4.34 are unable to load models, please revert to the older version.
