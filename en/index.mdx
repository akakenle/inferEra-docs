Welcome to AiHubMix, your reliable AI model API routing service. We use the **OpenAI API** as a standardized interface, capable of handling **all models officially supported by OpenAI**. Additionally, AiHubMix has incorporated other leading large language models on the market. Currently, we support models like **Claude**, **Gemini**, **Deepseek** and **Qwen**. You can switch between these models by simply modifying the `model name` in your request.

- AiHubMix is operated by the U.S.-registered company AiHubMix, LLC.
  - We ensure stable service and high concurrency for mainstream models like OpenAI and Claude. Many well-known applications are already leveraging our service in production environments, running smoothly.
- Our OpenAI endpoints interact with both OpenAI's official endpoint and Microsoft Azure OpenAI. Requests are randomly routed to either.
- Azure OpenAI has an automatic content filtering system, which processes both input and output. As a result, responses may be slightly slower.
- AiHubMix only performs simple routing and forwarding of model requests and outputs. To ensure safety, requests routed through OpenAI may randomly undergo Azure OpenAI’s content moderation. **Please refrain from submitting requests involving violent, political, or explicit content.** Accounts frequently triggering Azure’s content filter will be reviewed, and we may contact you for verification.

## Getting Started

1. Go to the **[Top-Up](https://aihubmix.com/topup)** page and add funds to ensure your account balance is greater than $0.

2. Navigate to the **[API Keys](https://aihubmix.com/token)** page to generate an API key. Copy your key for use in your applications.

Before using the API, you should have the following information:

```bash
api_key="sk-***",
base_url="https://aihubmix.com/v1"
```

- Alternative Server API Address: https://api.aihubmix.com

These two addresses are hosted on different servers. Save both for redundancy; if the primary server is under attack, you can switch to the alternative. You may test both to find the faster option for your region.

- If you're a developer, consult the OpenAI Official API Documentation:
  **[https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)**
In your development process, replace all instances of `https://api.openai.com` with the proxy API address `https://aihubmix.com`.

- For third-party chat or translation tools based on ChatGPT, refer to our **[Usage Instructions](https://docs.aihubmix.com/en/api/Non-OpenAI-Models)**.

- For the Claude model, we support the native `v1/messages` interface. Details are available here: [How to Use the Native Claude API](https://docs.aihubmix.com/en/Claude-Native).

- When entering a custom URL in applications, some may require parameters like `/v1/chat/completions` appended to the URL. The three most common formats are:
  1. `https://aihubmix.com`
  2. `https://aihubmix.com/v1`
  3. `https://aihubmix.com/v1/chat/completions`

- For detailed tutorials, check the guides available on the left-hand menu.
