## 1. Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to AIhubMix (hereinafter referred to as "we," "this service," or "AIhubMix"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legal agreement between you and AIhubMix regarding your use of our services. By accessing or using our website, API, or related services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our services.

## 2. Service Description

AIhubMix is a large model (LLM) API aggregation platform that provides access to various AI models, including but not limited to OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and others. Our services allow users to call these models through a unified API interface and provide additional features such as real-time online search. AIhubMix is currently in a testing phase; we may change or discontinue any part of the service at any time, including the availability of certain models. Some models marked as "experimental" are under evaluation to determine whether they receive sufficient usage and whether they meet our operational economics, and they may be removed at any time.

For the removal of non-experimental models, we will take the following measures:
- Provide notification on our official community channels
- For a certain period, we will reroute requests for that model to another model with similar pricing and functionality
- After a grace period of at least 2 weeks, we will stop rerouting requests for that model and return a 404 error instead

## 3. User Eligibility and Account Security

### 3.1 Age Requirement

Any person under the age of 13 is prohibited from using AIhubMix. You represent that you are at least the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, or if you are not of legal age, your parent or legal guardian must agree to these Terms and confirm that they accept these Terms on your behalf and assume responsibility for your use.

### 3.2 Registration Requirements

Using our services may require creating an account. You agree to provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date registration information and are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and completeness of that information.

### 3.3 Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, including the security of your password, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach.

### 3.4 API Key Security

You must keep your API key secure. A leaked API key may lead to unauthorized use and additional charges. We are not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from the leakage of your API key.

### 4.3 Content Responsibility

You are solely responsible for all materials sent through our API and any results received from the models (collectively referred to as "your content"). You retain all rights to your content. We do not monitor or control the content you create or process using our services and are not responsible for such content.

## 5. Fees and Payments

### 5.1 Pricing

Our services may incur charges. Current prices and billing terms are published on our website and may change from time to time. All fees are quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.

### 5.2 Billing Method

We charge based on API call volume, token consumption, or other usage metrics. The specific billing method depends on the service plan you choose and the models you use.

### 5.3 Payment Method

Users can purchase credits to pay for model fees using payment cards or cryptocurrency wallets. Credits are non-refundable and can be used to pay for model fees and can be recharged at any time. Credits may expire 12 months after purchase.

We use third-party payment processors to securely handle payments. Non-cryptocurrency payments may incur additional processing fees. If we receive a fraud dispute or any refund related to fraud for any of your payments, you will lose the corresponding amount of credits and the costs of handling the dispute.

Developers can pay for model fees themselves or allow users to pay through an authentication process. When using your own provider API key (via integration), we will deduct the corresponding service fees from your account.

### 5.4 Refund Policy

All fees are non-refundable unless required by applicable law. For prepaid users, unused balances may be refunded after account closure, depending on our policy at that time.
